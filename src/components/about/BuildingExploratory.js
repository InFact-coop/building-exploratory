      <h3>The Building Exploratory</h3>
      <p>The Building Exploratory is a learning and engagement organisation that
      helps communities discover the secrets of their local area. It works across
      London with schools, families, residents, older people, local authorities
      and businesses to engage them in celebrating their built environment, its
      heritage, buildings and public spaces. The Building Exploratory aims to
      improve access to information and give people opportunities to express
      their views about the neighbourhoods where they live and work.</p>
