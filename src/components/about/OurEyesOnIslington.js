      <p>The Islington Local List website was created as part of Our Eyes on
      Islington, a project delivered by the Building Exploratory over two years
      in partnership with Historic England and the London Borough of Islington.</p>

      <p>The project engaged a team of more than 55 volunteers who surveyed and
      researched all 2,000 items on Islington’s Local List. They visited and
      assessed each building, recording its condition and taking a set of
      documentary photographs. Archival research followed, with volunteers
      drawing on historic maps, trade and postal directories and historic
      drawings and photographs. Volunteers’ findings were reviewed and collated
      to provide a rich and detailed resource about Islington’s locally listed
      buildings, publicly available here for the first time.</p>

      <p>While the main aim of the project was to update Islington’s Local List
      and create a comprehensive resource, it also succeeded in showcasing and
      promoting Islington’s rich and diverse built heritage.</p>
