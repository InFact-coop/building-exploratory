      <p>Islington’s Local List provides a comprehensive source of information
      about the London Borough of Islington’s locally listed buildings, and
      structures such as post boxes, bollards, paving stones, and railings.
      The buildings and structures included have been given local listing status
      because they are considered to make a positive contribution to the local
      character and distinctiveness of the borough due to their architectural,
      historical or environmental significance.</p>

      <p>The 2,000 buildings and structures on Islington’s Local List have a
      wide range of uses from residential – homes and housing estates, and
      commercial – pubs, shops and offices, to places of worship – churches and
      mission halls. They come in a range of architectural styles: Georgian and
      Victorian architecture and 20th Century design are all represented.</p>

      <p>Buildings and other structures are added to the Local List according to
      a set of criteria carefully devised by Islington Council. Recommendations
      for new additions are made by members of the public or by the borough’s
      conservation officers. The ultimate decision about new additions is made
      by the borough’s planning sub-committee following a process of public
      consultation.</p>

      <p>While locally listed buildings are not subject to the strict planning
      requirements that apply to statutory listed buildings, local listed status
      can serve as a powerful tool for protecting local heritage assets. Once a
      Local List is adopted by a local authority it acts as supplementary
      planning guidance for those planning development or changes that impact on
      locally listed buildings.</p>

      <p>Islington’s rich and diverse heritage of buildings, historic structures,
      gardens and public spaces have been maintained and enhanced by the
      designation of statutory and local listings, and Conservation Areas. The
      borough also has a number of designated archaeological priority areas.</p>
